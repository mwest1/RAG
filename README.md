# RAG
A Repository to build RAG based solutions. As usual this is me mucking about 

The Goal of this project is to create a Flexible and targeted LLM that is small enough to run on a laptop, but functional enough to address some specialised use cases. The LLMs will use a small Open source model and will be augmented using RAG.
